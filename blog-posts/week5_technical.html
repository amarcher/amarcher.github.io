      <p class='title'> Craps Class </p>
      <p class='date'> Sunday, September 7, 2014 </p>
      <p class='text'> After working with <class>Class</code>es in Ruby this week to build "Die" objects, I could not resist the temptation to put these dice to use in a game. In this post, I want to explain Classes and how they can be put to use to make a command line version of the the classic casino dice game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craps">Craps</a> .</p>
      <p class='subtitle'> What's a <code>Class?</code> </p>
      <p class='text'> A Class is a data structure that defines the qualities and behaviors common to a certain kind of object. I like to think of it as a mold that stamps-out individual objects -- called 'instances' -- so that they behave in a perscribed way. To show an example: here's a Die class that defines how an instance of a die should look and behave: </p>
      <p class='text'>
        <pre class="prettyprint ruby">
          class Die
            def initialize(sides)
              raise ArgumentError, "Die must have at least one side!" unless sides > 0
              @sides = sides
            end

            def sides
              @sides
            end

            def roll
              rand(1..@sides)
            end
          end</pre>
      </p>
      <p class='subtitle'> What goes into a <code>Class</code> definition?</p>
      <p class='text'> In defining a <code>Class</code> you need to first specify how the Class 'constructs' an instance. You do this by defining <code>initialize</code> method that will be called from outside the Class definition like this:</p>
      <p class='text'>
        <pre class="prettyprint ruby">six_sided_die = Die.new(6)</pre>
      </p>
      <p class='text'> That Die.new "class method" will get handled by the #initialize method we define in the Die Class.</p>
      <p class='subtitle'> Instance Variables </p>
      <p class='text'> The argument(s) passed to the constructor allow it to set the enduring and salient attributes of this instance of the object -- the attributes that define it as an individual among its peers. We store these attributes in what are called "instance variables." In Ruby these begin with an '@' character. They are distinct from other types of variables (local or class variables) in that they have a very helpful scope: they are tied to this instance, are accessible to all methods defined for the instance, and may be configured to be read from, written to, or accessed by outside callers.
      <p class='subtitle'> Instance Methods </p>
      <p class='text'> In addition to defining attributes, a <code>Class</code> definition also needs to specify how the object behaves: what messages does it respond to and what should it do in response. We accomplish this with what are called instance methods. Let's look at the Craps game example to find these:</p>
      <p class='text'>
        <pre class="prettyprint ruby">class CrapsGame
  attr_reader :bankroll, :point, :unresolved_bets, :prev_roll

  def initialize(bankroll)
    @bankroll = bankroll
    @point = nil
    @unresolved_bets = []
    @prev_roll = Array.new(2)
  end

  def roll
    @prev_roll = Array.new(2) { Die.new(6).roll }
    puts "You rolled *#{@prev_roll[0]}* and *#{@prev_roll[1]}* for a total of **#{ @prev_roll[0] + @prev_roll[1] }**"
    resolve_bets
    determine_point
  end

  def bet(type, amount)
    name = type.intern
    raise ArgumentError, "There's no such bet as #{type}!" if (! BETS[name])
    @unresolved_bets << Bet.new(name, amount, @point)
    @bankroll -= amount
  end

  def walk_away
    @unresolved_bets.each {|bet| @bankroll += bet.payout_on_take_down}
  end

  private

  def resolve_bets
    @unresolved_bets.each { |bet| resolve_bet(bet) }
    @unresolved_bets.delete_if { |bet| bet.resolved? }
  end

  def resolve_bet(bet)
    @bankroll += bet.payout_on_roll(@prev_roll)
  end

  def determine_point
    roll_total = @prev_roll[0] + @prev_roll[1]
    if (! @point) && [4,5,6,8,9,10].include?(roll_total)
      @point = roll_total
      @unresolved_bets.each { |bet| bet.change_for_point(@point) }
      puts "#{ @point } is the point! Place your bets!"
    elsif roll_total == @point || (@point && roll_total == 7) # point hit or seven rolled
      @point = nil
      puts "Coming out! Place your bets!"
    end
  end
end</pre>
     </p>
     <p class='text'> Here we've defined several "public methods" -- these are significant messages that any Craps game should know how to respond to: <code>roll</code>, <code>bet</code>, and <code>walk_away</code>. We've also defined a set of "private methods" -- actions that the game needs to take on its own but no outside caller needs to have access to: <code>resolve_bets</code>, <code>resolve_bet</code>, and <code>determine_point</code>. These are the actions that the Craps game needs to perform on itself, but no outside callers need to perform. If you've ever been to a casino and played Craps you'll know: you don't need to tell the casino to take your money after a roll! They do this on their own in response to your roll.</p>
     <p class='subtitle'> Instantiating Objects of Other Classes </p>
     <p class='text'> You may have noticed that within our Craps class we instantiated objects of two other Classes. We did this in to get two Die and roll them in the context of the <code>roll</code> method definition:</p>
     <p class='text'>
     <pre class="prettyprint ruby">@prev_roll = Array.new(2) { Die.new(6).roll }</pre></p>
     <p class='text'> We also did it to create a Bet in the context of our <code>bet</code> method:</p>
     <p class='text'>
     <pre class="prettyprint ruby">@unresolved_bets << Bet.new(name, amount, @point)</pre></p>
     <p class='text'> This is where it gets fun! We are taking advantage of other Classes -- using them to create and use sophisticated data structures that have their useful attributes and functions! If you want to check out the Bet class and other required files you can find them here:
      <ul class='list'>

      Here's how it all looks when it's executed:
