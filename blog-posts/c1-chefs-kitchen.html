      <p class='title'> Reflections on the Dev Bootcamp Experience </p>
      <p class='date'> Sunday, August 10, 2014 </p>
      <p class='subtitle'>First impressions of DBC</p>
      <p class='text'>To be honest, afer finishing Week 1 of DevBootcamp's Phase 0, I'm kind of freaked out. I spent <strong><strong>twenty plus</strong> hours</strong> on the first DBC assignment and missed out on an entire day of fun on my much-anticipated trip to Portland this weekend to finish this assignment. Although I think I gained familiarity with some development tools and practices -- e.g. I'd never used <a href='http://www.github.com'>git</a> before and now feel pretty comfortable with it -- I felt like the expectations placed on us were extreme. The idea that we could (1) read many articles (2) go many modules of course work (3) commit reflections on every module and (4) engage with peers on many other modules was WAY more than I expected. I'm worried that I'd be able to accomplish in an average week. To fair, this week might have been atypical, there was a lot to ramp up on, I hadn't formed expectations about what I'd need to do, and I had some special circumstances come up with this travel to Portland.</p>

      <p class='subtitle'>Engaging with the DBC culture</p>
      <p class='text'>I think the biggest surprise to me so far is how reflection-based and community-driven DBC is. Every assignment asks you to reflect on what you've learned and to engage with peers in some way to provide feedback on their experience. Right now this feels awkward. I'm not used to opening up about how things went for me or asking for help (especially from peers). I think I'd convinced myself this looked like weekness. I understand now that that's actually just being fixed-minded -- my pride and my ego prevented me from opening up, admitting that I could have some fault, and be a more present member of a community.</p>

      <p class='subtitle'>Am I excited</p>
      <p class='text'>Yes. I'm nervous and excited. I think this experience will be life-changing. It will be hard -- that much is clear -- but I think it will change me in many positive ways. It promises to 'unstick' me not only from my non-technical career path as a project manager but from my very comfortable and 'established' (read: 'fixed') mindset.</p>

      <p class='subtitle'> Impressions on <a href='http://vimeo.com/85001014'>Shareef's Fireside Chat</a></p>
      <p class='text'>This video only validated my thoughts on DBC. It's good to hear it emphasized that this is a crazy 'experiment' and that it's expected DBC will challenge you to grow personally and professionally to meet that challenge.</p>

      <p class='subtitle'> Other thoughts on DBC</p>
      <p class='text'>Although I'm fatigued right now with all of the busy-work in Phase 0's Week 1, I'm eager to hit Week 2. I'm looking forward to budgeting more time and energy for that assignment so that I can go through exercises more carefully and engage more with peers more than I did this week.
