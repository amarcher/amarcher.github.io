      <p class='title'> Pairing & Feedback </p>
      <p class='date'>  Sunday, September 7, 2014  </p>
      <p class='text'> With just four weeks to go in our nine week ramp up to DevBootcamp, it's time to reflect on the experiences of pairing with peers and giving & receiving feedback.</p>
      <p class='subtitle'> Pairing </p>
      <p class='text'> After ~10 virtual pairing sessions, I have this to say: I'm looking forward to pairing in-person!</p>
      <p class='text'>I mean that in two ways: (1) I am really looking forward to pairing with peers in front of the same workstation, pointing to code on the screen, talking out what we want to do to address problems, researching our techniques, testing solutions, and confirm our understanding with one another <strong>in person</strong>.</p>
      <p class='text'>The other way I mean it is that I can't wait to graduate from this virtual pairing exercise we've been doing in Phase 0. You see, currently, our cohorts are dispersed across the country and we have to advertise and schedule times to pair on exercises. The overhead incurred is considerable. Once we find someone to pair with and attempt to connect across time-zones over Google Hangouts, we have to code on a screenshare or open a collaborative editing tool like <a href='http://stypie.com'>Stypie</a>. On multiple occasions these tools have frozen on one side of the connection necessitating some painful backtracking. I also had issues with audio on several occasions which definitely dampened the fun of the experience.</p>
      <p class='subtitle'> Feedback </p>
      <p class='text'>After every pairing session in Phase 0, we've been giving feedback to- and getting feedback from our partners. I've enjoyed the exercise of writing feedback. It forces me to think critically about why the session went well or went poorly and what suggestions I could offer my partner to help improve their next session. Through that exercise I realize the expectations I have for a pairing partner and remind myself that I should take specific steps to live up to those expectations <strong>myself</strong> the next time I pair. Two of the key lessons I've offered (to my pair and myself): when navigating, make sure you explain where you're intending to go before instructing your driver to code; and when driving, try not to touch the code until you're on the same page with your pair about how you're attacking the problem.</p>
      <p class='text'>As far as the feedback I've recieved from peers goes, I see a consistant message that I need to respect the pairing/driving roles that we agree to more strictly. It's been hard for me not to speak up when I feel like I have the solution, even if I'm driving. I recognize that I need to give my pair a chance to arrive at a solution and to express it when they are navigating. Similarly, I need to fight that urge say "here let me show you what I mean" and start typing when I'm the navigator. I need to talk my driver through the steps I'm asking them to take, letting them do the typing even if it's going to take us extra time. This will engage my peer in the process. It will also provide the benefit to me that I'll learn to express myself better verbally (instead of relying on the metaphorical whiteboard).</p>
      <p class='text'>Getting this feedback has not been as emotionally derailing as I imagined it might be. The criticism is unequivocally constructive because it is kind, well intentioned, and specific enough to be actionable. This is the DevBootcamp mandate (to give A.S.K. -- actionable, specific, and kind) feedback and so far I'm digging it.</p>
