      <p class='title'> Why Hasn't Technology Solved Education? </p>
      <p class='date'> Sunday, August 31, 2014 </p>
      <p class='subtitle'> The problem: </p>
      <p class='text'> Stated simply: The world's information is online, but much of the world still struggles to get an education on which they can base a career. Tech has an opportunity to reach and train much of the world's population but that hasn't happened yet. Here I examine why it hasn't yet.</p>
      <p class='subtitle'> Availability </p>
      <p class='text'> It's true: not everyone can access the internet, but there are *<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_Internet_users'>many</a>* students (or would-be students) who can. Countries with very high internet penetration, like the US (81%), have <a href='http://edsource.org/2013/u-s-scores-stagnant-other-nations-pass-by-in-latest-international-comparison/52052#.VAQZc1pdURQ'>much lower standardized test scores</a> than nations that have far lower internet penetration like Vietnam (39%). In other words, the reach of technology can't be the only reason it's not dramatically improved the world's education. </p>
      <p class='subtitle'> Discoverability </p>
      <p class='text'> The world's info is online, but can it be discovered? Search engines have evolved and can now answer most direct questions you could ask. If you want step-by-step instruction on a task ranging from tying a tie to solving an electrical circuit, you can find an (semi-)authoritative source -- say WikiPedia or YouTube -- with only a few key strokes. Studies show that >92% of internet users use search engines to find information, so that's not really the problem either.</p>
      <p class='subtitle'> Structure </p>
      <p class='text'> In school, teachers provide lesson plans. That's online too. It's also offered up (often for free) in curiculae courtesy of many online technology educators from the general (Khan Academy, Coursera) to the specific (Codecademy). You can even get a degree online (at cost) from universities with continuing education programs (University of Phoenix, Stanford CPD). Awareness of these structured resources (and means to pay for the accredited ones) is not universal, but the resources are there and do have users. The question is: are they effective? Some claim that these services don't actually increase student's ability to synthesize and apply knowledge in practical ways. The courses give mechanical skills that and proceedural knowledge that can improve understanding of key concepts. But whether this consistantly provides a propper foundation for a profession is largely unproven. Success stories are anecdotal at this point<a href='http://chronicle.com/blognetwork/castingoutnines/2013/02/11/does-khan-academy-help-learners-a-proposal/'>*</a> and ed-tech critics<a href='http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/why-tech-still-hasnt-solved-educations-problems/375879/'>*</a> claim that its promise is "mostly hot air". </p>
      <p class='subtitle'> Personalization </p>
      <p class='text'> Paul Franz argues that educating an individual is "uniquely difficult" and that a systematic approach only helps so much. An education still requires people (teachers). These teachers personalize instruction and adapt the training to the needs of the individual. Knowledge takes root when it is conveyed by teachers who can cater the program to the unique needs of the individual.</p>
      <p class='subtitle'> The way forward </p>
      <p class='text'> The idea of <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vMO3XmNXe4'>Matrix-esque education</a> will likely remain science-fiction for the forseeable future. Technology will aide an education, but teachers (and their direct contact with students) will continue to play an important role that can't be overstated. Instead of replacing teachers and their interaction with students, educational technology seems to be embracing it. Our DevBootcamp course, for example, requires personal check-ins with instructors and these instructors make themselves available for "office hours" with students. Personally, I've found the program to be extremely effective largely because of these interactions that (a) let me know I'm on/off pace and (b) help me through extremely frustrating "sticking points" that are likely unique to me and my circumstances. I see this approach being the optimal way forward: technology that structures training but also brings students and teachers into regular, compulsory contact.</p>
