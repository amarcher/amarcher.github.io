      <p class='title'> Stereotype Threat </p>
      <p class='date'> Saturday, September 13, 2014 </p>
      <p class='subtitle'> A Definition </p>
      <p class='text'> <a href='http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html'>Stereotype Threat</a> is defined as the "risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group." The term was coined by Sociology researchers, among them: Claude M. Steele, to explain the reproducible observation that stereotyped groups (e.g. women, elderly, African Americans) would underperform at tasks/tests in circumstances that reminded them of a negative stereotype. For example, one <a href='http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/bibliography_good_aronson_harder.html'>study</a> showed that women in a college Math course had lower scores on a tests when it was described as "diagnostic of ability" and higher test scores when assured that the test was "free of gender-bias." The theory was that women were reminded of the negative stereotypes of womens' ability in the field of Math relative to men exist which affected their performance -- effectively confirming the stereotype. </p>
      <p class='subtitle'> My Experiences </p>
      <p class='text'> After reading up on Stereotype Threat, I've started to believe it's a very real phenomenon and I want to combat it. Just last night: my girlfriend told me at dinner: "For most my life I've kind of thought that because my parents were immigrants and not well-off that the best I could aspire to be is maybe slightly better off. I thought maybe I just didn't have the right components in my upbringing to do any better for myself than that." This sounds like stereotype threat to me: she's reminded that she could be handicapped by her status as a first generation American. That perception, if left unchecked, could undermine her confidence and temper her ambition to realize her full potential.</p>
      <p class='subtitle'> Beating It </p>
      <p class='text'> To beat stereotype threat, I think it helps to break down what causes it. In my opinion there are three components:
      <ul class='list'>
        <li>The awareness that negative stereotypes about one's group exist</li>
        <li>The latent fear that these stereotypes could be accurate OR could be confirmed by one's performance </li>
        <li>Cues or reminders that aggrevate those fears</li>
      </ul></p>
      <p class='text'>It's hard to aim a solution at the first of these. Societies have formed negative stereotypes for as long as humans have lived in them, and as long as negative stereotypes exist, we can't expect individuals to be uninformed about them. As individuals, we can only do our part by telling others who would spread them that these opinions aren't welcome. This may impede their dissemination.</p>
      <p class='text'>Beating the second component requires confidence on the part of the stereotyped individual. They have to be bold enough to put these fears out of mind or rise above them. As supporters, we can encourage them to build this confidence. For instance, I can remind my girlfiend that her potential is not bounded by her first-generation American status, that I believe in her for her individual abilities, and that she should believe in herself too.</p>
      <p class='text'>The third component is the one that receives the most attention from researchers because the impacts of remedies to address it (removing cues from performance contexts) are measurable. Knowing that these remedies have a proven effect, we should do our best to remove reminders of negative stereotypes in any context where they are likely to trigger fears. Going into DevBootcamp, I know we are entering such an environment. I plan to elevate my conscienciousness of possible cues and endeavor to keep them out of conversation. I want my classmates to have the best experience and I want them to perform up to their potential unhindered by stereotype threat.</p>
