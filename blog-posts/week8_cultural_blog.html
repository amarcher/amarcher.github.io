      <p class='title'> Dealing with Conflict </p>
      <p class='date'> Sunday, September 28, 2014 </p>
      <p class='text'>This week I'd like to explore an incident where I dealt with an emotional conflict in a less than optimal way and explore how I could have handled it better.</p>
      <p class='subtitle'> The conflict?</p>
      <p class='text'>In 2005, I was a graduate student in Chemistry at Cornell in a particularly snowy area of the world. I was living off campus with a few friends. Our program was incredibly demanding, and I was feeling unenthusiastic about the subject to make matters worse. I decided after a year that I needed to shake things up. I'd move closer to the campus. I told my roommates, then a few weeks later I found a place. I told them then that I'd be leaving very soon. One of them decided he wanted to take my room and asked me when exactly I'd be moved out so that he could paint it. I threw out a date: "I should be out by next Wednesday." My lease started Monday, so I thought two days of overlap would leave me enough time to move my stuff. Of course, Monday and Tuesday were workdays: I had class all morning, lab work to do in the afternoon, and I had sections to teach in the evenings. Suffice it to say -- I was not fully moved out of the apartment as the sun set on Tuesday night. At 10pm,I was in my old room packing what seemed like an insurmountable amount stuff. My roommate confronted me, paintbrush and open paint-can in hand and asked me: "Could take your s*** off the walls already so that I can start painting. You said you'd be out by Wednesday."</p>
      <p class='text'>I was furious: I'd been working hard all day, and now I was covered in sweat, packing my stuff without any assistance, and here was a friend -- not offering to help -- but insisting that I get out of his way even earlier than I'd agreed.</p>
      <p class='subtitle'>How I handled it</p>
      <p class='text'>On the <a href='http://southdown.on.ca/publications/articles/Compass-of-Shame.pdf'>Compass of Shame</a> I handled this situation on the "West" ordinance. I'm not proud of it, but I lashed out. Loudly, I told my friend that his concerns were the least of mine, that I had said I'd be out Wednesday, and it wasn't Wednesday, and that I considered him less of a friend for coming to confront me. </p>
      <p class='subtitle'>Did it work?</p>
      <p class='text'>No. Predictably, this impulsive response didn't help. My roommate didn't drop his paint brush and offer to help me move. He just walked off. I managed to finish packing on my own, but this confrontation put a rift between a friend and I that took weeks to resolve.</p>
      <p class='subtitle'>What would I do differently?</p>
      <p class='text'>I would (1) communicate with humility and (2) empathise. First, I would set the right expectation that a "Wednesday move-out" was an aspirational date and I would humbly appeal for help hitting it. Second, I would try to see this situation from the perspective of the other (my roommate). He wanted to paint Tuesday night. He'd clearly planned to do it, and now he was intent on it. I could have empathized, apologized that the walls were still covered, and at least asked for his help removing items from the walls.</p>
      <p class='subtitle'>What did you learn from this experience? </p>
      <p class='text'>It sounds trite, but I learned to that losing my cool and lashing out was not productive. I let out my stress and anger, but this didn't get me anywhere. Dealing with this conflict (and future ones) in a humble, communicative, and empathetic way would clearly have been preferable. If nothing else, I would have been happier with myself for keeping my composure, being reasonable, and humanistically taking the high road. </p>
