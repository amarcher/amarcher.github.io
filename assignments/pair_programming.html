                <p>
                    Pair programming is an important development practice in which you create code in a collaborative setting with another coder.

                <p>
                    Pair-Programming is important because it allows the pair to catch each other's errors, check through concepts, and learn from each other.
                    Even if you know more/less than the other pair, it allows you to solidify concepts and/or ask questions in a personal setting.

                <p>
                    Pair in person if possible. Do a check-in before you start. Decide roles (navigator/driver) and plan to switch. Be kind, open-minded, and provide A.S.K. feedback.
